Helm Charts for Tink

## Quick Start

This guide will walk you through a series of steps to package, upload and deploy helm charts.

### Step 1. Fork

1. Visit <https://github.com/no8ge/chartrepo>
2. Click `Fork` button to create a fork of the project to your GitHub account.

## Step 2. Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/no8ge/chartrepo.git && cd chartrepo/
Cloning into ‘chartrepo’…
remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
```

## Step 3. Lint the chart

As a good habit, helm lint runs a series of tests to verify that
the chart is well-formed:

```bash
helm lint ../you-project/charts/*
```

## Step 4. Create the Helm chart package

```bash
$ helm package ../you-project/charts/*
Successfully packaged chart and saved it to: /Users/iot/git/helm-chart/helm-chart-test-0.1.0.tgz
```

### Step 5. Create the Helm chart repository index

```bash
According to Helm:
A repository is characterized primarily by the presence of a special file called index.yaml that has a list of all of the packages supplied by the repository, together with metadata that allows retrieving and verifying those packages.
So, everything we need to create is the index.yaml file and the command to do that is:
$ helm repo index --url https://no8ge.github.io/chartrepo/ .
$ cat index.yaml
apiVersion: v1
entries:
helm-chart-test:
- apiVersion: v1
  appVersion: "1.0"
